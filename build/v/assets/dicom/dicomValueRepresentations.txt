"19930822" would represent August 22, 1993.
Note
The ACR-NEMA Standard 300 (predecessor to DICOM) supported a string of characters of the format YYYY.MM.DD for this VR. Use of this format is not compliant.
See also DT VR in this table.
Dates before year 1582, e.g., used for dating historical or archeological items, are interpreted as proleptic Gregorian calendar dates, unless otherwise specified.
Alternatively, in the context of a Query with Empty Value Matching (see PS3.4), a string of two QUOTATION MARK characters, representing an empty key Value.

A floating point number shall be conveyed as defined in ANSI X3.9, with an "E" or "e" to indicate the start of the exponent. Decimal Strings may be padded with leading or trailing spaces. Embedded spaces are not allowed.
Note
Data Elements with multiple Values using this VR may not be properly encoded if Explicit-VR Transfer Syntax is used and the VL of this Data Element exceeds 65534 bytes.
"0"-"9", "+", "-", "E", "e", "." and the SPACE character of Default Character Repertoire
16 bytes maximum

------------ DT -------------
Date Time
A concatenated date-time character string in the format:
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.FFFFFF&ZZXX
The components of this string, from left to right, are YYYY = Year, MM = Month, DD = Day, HH = Hour (range "00" - "23"), MM = Minute (range "00" - "59"), SS = Second (range "00" - "60").
FFFFFF = Fractional Second contains a fractional part of a second as small as 1 millionth of a second (range "000000" - "999999").
&ZZXX is an optional suffix for offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), where & = "+" or "-", and ZZ = Hours and XX = Minutes of offset.
The year, month, and day shall be interpreted as a date of the Gregorian calendar system.
A 24-hour clock is used. Midnight shall be represented by only "0000" since "2400" would violate the hour range.
The Fractional Second component, if present, shall contain 1 to 6 digits. If Fractional Second is unspecified the preceding "." shall not be included. The offset suffix, if present, shall contain 4 digits. The string may be padded with trailing SPACE characters. Leading and embedded spaces are not allowed.
A component that is omitted from the string is termed a null component. Trailing null components of Date Time indicate that the Value is not precise to the precision of those components. The YYYY component shall not be null. Non-trailing null components are prohibited. The optional suffix is not considered as a component.
A Date Time Value without the optional suffix is interpreted to be in the local time zone of the application creating the Data Element, unless explicitly specified by the Timezone Offset From UTC (0008,0201).
UTC offsets are calculated as "local time minus UTC". The offset for a Date Time Value in UTC shall be +0000.
Alternatively, in the context of a Query with Empty Value Matching (see PS3.4), a string of two QUOTATION MARK characters, representing an empty key Value.
Note
The range of the offset is -1200 to +1400. The offset for United States Eastern Standard Time is -0500. The offset for Japan Standard Time is +0900.
The RFC 2822 use of -0000 as an offset to indicate local time is not allowed.
A Date Time Value of 195308 means August 1953, not specific to particular day. A Date Time Value of 19530827111300.0 means August 27, 1953, 11;13 a.m. accurate to 1/10th second.
The Second component may have a Value of 60 only for a leap second.
The offset may be included regardless of null components; e.g., 2007-0500 is a legal Value.
"0"-"9", "+", "-", "." and the SPACE character of Default Character Repertoire
In the context of a Query with Empty Value Matching (see PS3.4), the QUOTATION MARK character is allowed.

------------ PN -------------
Person Name
A character string encoded using a 5 component convention. The character code 5CH (the BACKSLASH "\" in ISO-IR 6) shall not be present, as it is used as the delimiter between Values in multi-valued Data Elements. The string may be padded with trailing spaces. For human use, the five components in their order of occurrence are: family name complex, given name complex, middle name, name prefix, name suffix.
Note
HL7 prohibits leading spaces within a component; DICOM allows leading and trailing spaces and considers them insignificant.
Any of the five components may be an empty string. The component delimiter shall be the caret "^" character (5EH). There shall be no more than four component delimiters, i.e., none after the last component if all components are present. Delimiters are required for interior null components. Trailing null components and their delimiters may be omitted. Multiple entries are permitted in each component and are encoded as natural text strings, in the format preferred by the named person.
For veterinary use, the first two of the five components in their order of occurrence are: responsible party family name or responsible organization name, patient name. The remaining components are not used and shall not be present.
This group of five components is referred to as a Person Name component group.
For the purpose of writing names in ideographic characters and in phonetic characters, up to 3 groups of components (see Annex H, Annex I and Annex J) may be used. The delimiter for component groups shall be the equals character "=" (3DH). There shall be no more than two component group delimiters, i.e., none after the last component group if all component groups are present. The three component groups of components in their order of occurrence are: an alphabetic representation, an ideographic representation, and a phonetic representation.
Any component group may be absent, including the first component group. In this case, the person name may start with one or more "=" delimiters. Delimiters are required for interior null component groups. Trailing null component groups and their delimiters may be omitted.
Precise semantics are defined for each component group. See Section 6.2.1.2.
For examples and notes, see Section 6.2.1.1.

Leading and embedded spaces are not allowed.
One or more of the components MM, SS, or FFFFFF may be unspecified as long as every component to the right of an unspecified component is also unspecified, which indicates that the Value is not precise to the precision of those unspecified components.
The FFFFFF component, if present, shall contain 1 to 6 digits. If FFFFFF is unspecified the preceding "." shall not be included.
Examples:
"070907.0705 " represents a time of 7 hours, 9 minutes and 7.0705 seconds.
"1010" represents a time of 10 hours, and 10 minutes.
"021 " is an invalid Value.
